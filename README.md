# Intro

Ever got impressed by the most mind-blowing ideas of theoretical physics?

The time of lab experiments in physics is rather gone, because nowadays our fantasy about how the universe works in micro and macro scales goes beyond our practical ability to test and verify stuff. How do researchers know they are right about their ideas? It's all about logic.

What we are doing in science is trying to *reconstruct* the laws of the universe (the system) in our heads using Boolean algebra. We are trying to put rules on top of each other and try to verify whether they are `true` or `false`. What an analogy to software development?

With growing set of rules our *reconstruction* of the universe (the system) gets bigger and our heads are not big enough to compare all established `true` rules with new ideas. And so happens that we have 2 different theories largely backed by many `true` rules, but they don't make sense with each other together in certain parts, like the quantum physics and the theory of relativity.

Fortunately, we have these wonderful things called computers that can do stuff for us. We can build a massive database of rules and have a machine comparing all established `true` rules with rules coming from new ideas and verify them this way. I am confident about building an experiment system for verifying massively complex theoretical sciences like physics. Imagine it like **unit testing of science**.

Once such a system is built, which can store *rules of theories* in both human and machine readable way, it can not only serve the mankind in verifying new and existing theories, it may also... try to generate new theories automatically.

I know I can't do this on my own. I would like to invite you to think with me about such an experiment practically and attempt to create a real project.

Let's start by thinking [what could the data structure look like](https://github.com/Codename-METASYS/theory/issues/1).
